    <h1>Time, Space,and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of the computational efficiency of an algorithm, representing how the execution time grows relative to the size of the input. It helps determine how efficiently an algorithm performs as input scales, with common notations like O(n), O(log n), or O(nÂ²) describing different growth rates. Analyzing time complexity is crucial for selecting the most efficient solution, especially for large-scale problems, where minimizing unnecessary computations can significantly enhance performance.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to execute, relative to the size of its input. It includes both the space needed for the input data and any additional storage used during execution. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) uses memory proportional to the input size. Understanding space complexity is vital for designing efficient algorithms, especially in memory-constrained environments, as it ensures optimal resource utilization.</p>
